# Simple REST Application with MongoDB

## Project Overview

This is a simple RESTful application built with Spring Boot using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, and MongoDB as the database. The application provides CRUD operations for managing resources (e.g., users, products, etc.). It's designed to be a starting point for building more complex applications.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: The project is structured based on the MVC pattern, separating the application logic, data, and user interface.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing data.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Uses MongoDB as the NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **RESTful API**: Exposes a set of RESTful endpoints to interact with the data.
- **Spring Boot**: Backend framework used to build and manage the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**: Programming language.
- **Spring Boot 3**: Framework for building the REST API with MVC architecture.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data.
- **Maven**: Build and dependency management tool.
- **Postman**: For testing API endpoints (optional).

## Prerequisites

- **Java 17**: Make sure Java is installed and set up on your machine.
- **Maven**: Ensure Maven is installed for building and running the project.
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB should be installed and running locally or accessible via a cloud service.
